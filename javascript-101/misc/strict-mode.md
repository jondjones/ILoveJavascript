# Strict Mode

```javascript
'use strict'
```

Stirct-mode will enforce stricter JS parsing by the compiler.  You should use this to increase the odds of you not making silly mistakes.  This will cause an error in strict mode.  This line will compile OK in normal mode

```javascript
asdf = 'error';
```
You should use strict-mode to prevent accidental global variables from being created
